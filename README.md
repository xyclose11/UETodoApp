## Planned Features
- Undo/Redo for edit and removal
- Data persistence through saved files
- Manual search implementation with a Trie or some similar DS
- Manual sort implementation using different algorithims (Purerly for practice and personal understanding) 
- Seperate table class to improve dynamic ability of the CLI appearance for how todo items are displayed
- Add a checked option so that users can mark a todo which will only change its appearance rather than remove it
- Add the ability to have multiple todo lists

## Motivation
The main motivation behind the creation of UETodo App is to fill current gaps inside my current knowledge and understanding of CLI's and DSA overall.
If you peruse through the code you will notice that the application as a whole has some questionable design choices, but fear not for I intended on reinventing some well known wheels (I.E. Creation of my own version of an ArrayList, etc).
